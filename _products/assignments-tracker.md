# Freelancing Assignments, Invoices & Incomes Tracker

## Spreadsheet Template for Apple Numbers
This is a free spreadsheet template for [Apple Numbers](https://www.apple.com/numbers/), to help you keeping track of your past and future invoices and clients payments. The template is set in €, although you can change that in Numbers. It has a 21% VAT column which you can customize to your country's percentage, remove or set to 0% if VAT doesn't apply. The net earning column gives you an idea of your actual earnings . Check with your accountant which percentage best applies to you. Add or remove rows as you see fit. The template covers a full year.
