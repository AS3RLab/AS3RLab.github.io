## Free PDF anime storyboard template for 1.85:1 films, in Japanese

Get these 2 free anime storyboard templates on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page in PDF format, ready for print. The layout has 5 frames per sheet. Each storyboard frame sets an exact 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen) white space for pictures. This layout is drawing inspiration from the amazing Studio Ghibli storyboards.

The first PDF template is a clean sheet with the frames and boxes. The second has dotted lines for a production title in the header, and for numbering your pages in the footer.

Print it out as it is to work on paper, the old school way (no cheating).

**Boxes:**

- The first column, **カット** indicates cuts. Use it to number your shots.
- The second and main column is **画面** which stands for the picture screen. That’s where you draw or place your storyboard shots.
- **内容** stands for content, use this space for your notes (dialogue, action, etc.)
- The last column, **秒** is for annotating the duration of your shots in seconds.


If you like to draw your storyboards on paper and need to work within 1.85:1 ratio, this anime template will save you time and help you design beautiful storyboards!
