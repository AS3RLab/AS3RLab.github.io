## Free PDF storyboard template for 1.85:1 aspect ratio anime films

This is a free storyboard template in PDF format on DIN A4 vertical (portrait) page, designed for print. This template has 5 frames per sheet each in 1.85:1 aspect ratio (Widescreen). The layout is inspired by the beautiful storyboards from Studio Ghibli.

- The first column indicates **cuts**. Use it to number your shots—you can have several pictures for the same shot.
- The second and main column is the picture **screen**. That’s where you draw your storyboard shots.
- Then there is a space for your script **notes**: action, dialogue, etc.
- The last column, **time**, is for writing the duration of your shots in seconds.

Print it out to draw on paper, the old school way, or import it into Adobe Photoshop, and use the template to frame your work in multiply mode and draw your storyboard on a new layer underneath it.
