## Soon is a simple "coming soon" page built for Jekyll.

Soon is a single static page with a full-screen image, nothing more. Remember those under construction sites? The point is to show a quick message or a temporary contact page to your visitors. Use this template for a few hours to a few days while you are building your site in the background. Since the page comes with a Jekyll environment, you can host it for free on GitHub.

Start Soon
[Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), then using the command line, cd soon then run jekyll serve to test the page locally (localhost:4000). You can self host or use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) to publish the site.

You just need to modify the `_config` and `index.md` files with your site information to get the page up and running. Although it is just a starting point and you can change pretty much anything else. If you change the background image, donâ€™t forget to link the new image in `_layouts/default.html`. You will find the background image in the **images** folder.

Soon comes with all the Jekyll starting folders. This means you can publish your Soon page and restyle, write and test your site locally. Once happy with your layouts for posts, pages, collections, and any other site assets, you can overwrite the original files and push your site online.

The sooner you start building your site the better. Since you wanted to install Jekyll anyway, Soon comes with all the usual starting folders to run a complete Jekyll site or blog. This means you can publish your Soon page and restyle, write and test your site in the background. Once you are happy with your layouts for posts, pages, collections and anything else in your site assets you can just overwrite everything and push your live site.
