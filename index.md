Yuqi Chen is an assistant Professor (tenure-track) at School of Information Science and Technology in the ShanghaiTech University. Yuqi completed his Ph.D. in 2019 at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the supervision of Sun Jun. Besides, he also collaborated closely with Chris Poskitt. From 2019 to 2021, he worked as a Research Scientist in the System Analysis and Verification (SAV) group at Singapore Management University(SMU).

His research interest lies in cyber-physical system security in general. Specifically, he apply techniques like testing, reverse engineering, program analysis, and formal method to secure and analyze CPSs (e.g., autonomous vehicles, industrial control systems, and robotics systems).

### Recruitment

I am looking for self-motivated PhD/MS students, postdoc, and research assistant to conduct research in areas of software engineering, system security, AI security, and autonomous vehicles. Please feel free to drop me an email with your CV if you are interested.
